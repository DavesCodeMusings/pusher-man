Keep track of your prescription drug doses using HTML local storage instead of some sketchy cloud thing.

I slapped this together after having surgery as a way to keep track of my meds. It uses HTML5 Local Storage to keep the information, well, local. It is not encrypted, but it's also not shared anywhere outside of the device where the application is installed. You can use it as a learning tool if you wish. If you want to go out on a limb and use it for your own medication tracking, you'll want to edit `meds.json` to customize your choices. Please pay special attention to the clause in the license file about no warranties and no liability. If you mess up your doses and start glitching in and out of cyberpsychosis or unalive yourself, that's on you, not me.

>The man with the guitar who appears through the magic of CSS on wide screen renditions of the app is none other than the legendary Curtis Mayfield, writer of the song Pusher Man, from which this app takes its name.
